# Mniscence

An early and WIP LiveView app for interacting with Mnesia databases.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint inside IEx with `iex --name mniscence@localhost -S mix phx.server`. Phoenix needs to be started with a name so that it is started on a distributed node.

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
